<h2>Steps To Make An Apple Pie</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Mix the baking powder, salt and flour for the dough, then crumble it with the cold butter. Add the eggs, sugar, and mix thoroughly. Refrigerate for at least half an hour.</li>
    <li>Peel the apples, grate them on a large-hole grater and squeeze them. Season with sugar, cinnamon and lemon juice.</li>
    <li>After cooling, divide the dough into 2 part and roll it out on a floured surface for approx. to a thickness of half a centimeter.</li>
    <li>Line the bottom of a 38x26 cm baking tray with baking paper, place the first portion of rolled out dough on it, prick it with a fork and sprinkle it thinly with breadcrumbs. Spread the apple filling on it, then cover it with the other half of the rolled out dough. We also prick the top.</li>
    <li>Bake for approximately 30-40 minutes in an oven preheated to 180Â°C with air stirring on.  When cooled, sprinkle with powdered sugar and cut into cubes for serving.</li>
