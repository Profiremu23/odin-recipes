<p>This chicken escalope recipe, flavoured with lemon zest and parsley, is a great go-to for a weekday dinner. While chicken escalopes require a little extra effort to prepare, theyâ€™re definitely worth it - and will cook through in just eight minutes. Before shallow frying, the chicken breasts must be tenderised. We suggest flattening it out and beating with a mallet or a rolling pin. This technique breaks down the fibres in the meat, making it more tender and helping it cook faster. For larger chicken breasts, you may want to butterfly the meat beforehand. Serve with homemade chips and green vegetables.</p>
